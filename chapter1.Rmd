# About the project
  
Hi! I've used R before, but the first week has been great to repeat some syntax. I do expect to learn **Markdown** since it has been in my to-do list for years. This course was recommended to me by my doctoral school.  
This is my [project](https://github.com/dobrego/IODS-project)
